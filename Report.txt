Stacy Schauls	Cpts131 Homework Week 15 Challenge Version	

1. I got started with this assignment by first drawing a picture of how this mapping should work. Needless
to say it wasnt a very good picture.

2. What worked was fully thinking through the process, thinking how I would implement this if I were
to do it on pen and paper. What didnt work was trying to rush through it and get it done.
	
3. I learned how to map and think more critically about problems. Also how to access and use SQL more efficiently

4. Next time I will create a smaller project, mentally and ask myself how I would go about solving the problem.
